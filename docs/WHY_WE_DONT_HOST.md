# Why we don't host bot anymore?

## The reasons

There are several reasons why we stopped to host our own public Snowball Bot copy along with some other related bots of SnowballBot project (former name).

- SnowballBot project is being transferred to Snowball Developer Group as Snowball Bot (see that space, unique and required change).

  We want to have more nicer structure of our project, so we decided to create Snowball Developer Group. And the bot's project being transferred to SDG.

  We almost finished this. While we doing this, we still can work on the project.

- The existence of this project is under consideration.

  We don't like advertising. We don't want to advertise our bot anywhere, because we don't know how it'll act on big number of servers.

  Because of this only a very small percent of people knows about our bot.

  - We don't have resources for further hosting

    We ran out of money and could not host bot on the same machine anymore.

    For some of SDG servers we're hosting our own bot copy on a pretty small and cheap server.

  - We don't have contributors

    The bot is being developed by a single person and they may not have time or possibility to do it further.

    So if we'll decide to work on the bot we first need to improve documentation and structure to make it easy for new contributors join the project.

- Other private issues.

## We're sorry for that

We really did not want let our partners down but with all these reasons we had no choices. To help our partners we're exported the SnowballBot data, so if they want, they can host bot manually.

## There's other bots at least

Partners and friends now have choice to either host bot by themselves or use other bots.

We suggest you to use [blargbot](https://blargbot.xyz/), it is pretty configurable and cool bot. Thought, you can also look at [Dyno Bot](https://www.dynobot.net/). Anyway, there are much alternative bots that possibly can replace all of Snowball Bot functional.

Don't forget that you can [host your own copy of Snowball Bot](/docs/INSTALLATION.md). And we can help you with this, *just ASK, just ASK, just ASK, just ASK*.

## It may come back

There's hope. No warranty something not happens and project gets abandoned forever. But currently we're slowly but working on it. So when we do improve and change something, we might consider open fund for a hosting and then host bot again.

But this not gonna happen without your support. We much appreciate any of your help on this project. If you wish to contribute, follow the [contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Once progress happens you'll get notified on our [Discord servers](/README.md#join-our-discord-servers).
