# Installation Guide

We're glad you want to set up your own copy of Snowball Bot.

This is not as hard as it may seem. We're trying to keep that process really easy.

## Please, remember

Snowball project is continuously developing.

- We don't really have such terms as "stable". **Every build may contain a lot of bugs**.

While we have **"staged", "stable" branches** it **doesn't really mean that these versions are really more stable**.

- "Staged" refers to version that we actively use right now in production. Remember that we love to test things in production, so be prepare for testings
- "Stable" means version that doesn't contains new untested changes yet. It's unstable and old, don't trust this one. Thank you

Some branches may rarely get updates and be outdated because our team is pretty lazy to update them. Yes, I know it's only two commands. What do you mean this is not okay? Pick our best commits and run them if you so dislike how we organize things!!! (Ôæâ‡≤•Áõä‡≤•ÔºâÔæâÂΩ°‚îª‚îÅ‚îª)

So... We recommend you to stick with the staged version or maybe manually checkout to latest commits which were tested by you and should not do anything harmful.

This guide is based on Ubuntu server. We haven't tested and tried to install Snowball Bot on other systems but it should not be a really big problem: most of the tools that we use are cross-platform, except... Redis. Well, Redis has no builds for Windows, but there's community versions and they should work just fine.

If you're hosting Snowball Bot on Windows, please share your results of such hosting in a special channel for developers and hosts on [our Discord servers][discord_links].

This guide lacks of information? Some things said wrong? [Read how you can contribute your fixes][contribution_doc] for this guide.

Okay, nuff said here.

## Requirements

We don't have much requirements, because the values are so dynamic we can't write them down. This all depends on usage of your bot.

- For small Discord servers (~500 members) Snowball should be easy to host even on **512MB/1 vCore machines**. Enable SWAP if you're not 100% sure it'll handle load
- Snowball Bot working directory size by default is about 2MB in length, but when you install dependencies, this size increases **up to 50MB** (beware!)
- **You're not required to provide Snowball Bot root access**. Even more, we don't not recommend provide any root access to bot, host it on separate account to be safe

## Preparation

First of all you need to have copy of Snowball Bot build.

To obtain your own build, you can:

### Build project manually

If you wish to customize building and make some changes to the code, you can read our [guide about the building the project][building_doc].

### Download the recent builds from our CI artifacts

GitLab CI builds our branches on every commit. Building will fail if there's any errors in the code or with modules. We don't have tests (yet?).

You can find recent artifacts [on this GitLab CI page][gitlab_ci]. Even that these contain `node_modules` you may need to manually install dependencies as they can depend on your system and contain developer dependencies.

## Storing stuff

We're using MariaDB and Redis to store data. There's also local node cache which disappears on every bot restart, so except bot process will use more memory as long it works (at some point RAM usage should stop to increase).

### MariaDB / MySQL

MariaDB / MySQL are used to store any "long-needed" data such as archives, active notifications, subscriptions or user's preferences.

If you don't plan to use bot globally but only on your servers, then you're okay without much knowledge of DB hosting stuff.

- Our modules manually create tables and do migrations if that required. You'll still be required to create database for these tables

#### Installing the MariaDB / MySQL

There you have a choice of what to use for storing your data. We use MariaDB, but you can use MySQL if you want to. There's not much difference and both work pretty well with Snowball.

Why we made such choice? They are really easy to set up and configure. We got many troubles setting up other database engines (maybe because we aren't good at it).

If you're the developer and wish to help us make support for more database storage types (like PostgreSQL ‚ù§), please read ["how to contribute"][contribution_doc].

So, back to the installation. There's needed information:

- [Guide on MariaDB installation][mariadb_installation]
- [Guide on MySQL installation][mysql_installation]

#### Configuration

1. To ensure that emoji will be saving correctly you need to change which ~~encoding~~ character set will be used.

    So here's is what we changed in our config:

    ```ini
    [mysqld]
    init_connect='SET collation_connection = utf8mb4_unicode_ci'
    init_connect='SET NAMES utf8mb4'
    character-set-server=utf8mb4
    collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
    skip-character-set-client-handshake

    [mysql]
    default-character-set=utf8mb4
    ```

    You need to change this in `my.cfg` file which location may vary depending on system.

2. You need to create a user account in your MySQL/MariaDB.

    Make sure to grant it the permission to create tables.

    PRO TIP: make your database accessible from the "outside", create your account (to avoid usage of `root`) and use [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) to manage the databases.

3. Create database for bot to store its tables.

    By default Snowball Bot uses `snowbot` database. So you can create it with the default name.

1. Don't forget to run `mysql_secure_installation` command to ensure database security for production use.

Google is your best friend on configuring MySQL/MariaDB server.

#### Telling secrets to our bot

Snowball Bot should know which user and password to use for establishing the connection with the database.

You need to change these environment variables (*well, if you need to, most of them have default values*).

- `DB_HOST`: Where database is hosted (`127.0.0.1` by default)
- `DB_NAME`: Name of database where bot will store their tables (`snowbot` by default)
- `DB_PASSWD`: Password for database user
- `DB_USER`: Name of user who connecting to database (`snowballbot` by default)

### Redis

Redis is even more easy to install and doesn't require much configuration.

We use Redis to store temporary cache like Overwatch profiles.

#### Installing the Redis

There's awesome guide on [how to install and configure Redis server on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-redis-on-ubuntu-16-04) by DigitalOcean community.

There's no official builds for Windows, so you need to google all this stuff.

#### Psst, Snowball Bot. I got the number for Redis!

Again, we're back to environment variables, here's the list to Redis-related ones:

- `REDIS_HOST`: Where Redis is hosted (`127.0.0.1` by default)
- `REDIS_PORT`: Redis port (`6379` by default)
- `REDIS_PASSWD`: Redis password (none by default)

## Installing Snowball

### 1. Node.js

Before continuing you should have Node.js installed on your server.

To install Node.js follow [these instructions][node_installation].

‚ö† **You may need to [build Node.JS manually with ICU support](https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki/Intl) or [install full-icu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/full-icu) in order to display localized dates and use [Intl API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl)**.

### 2. Editing configuration

See ["configuration" document][configuration_doc], it describes how to properly configure everything.

### 3. Uploading package

So you have got artifacts or built the project by yourself.

In the second case, you would have the directory named `out`, this is "ready-to-deploy" package (folder).

Upload it somewhere to your server with SFTP or anything else.

### 4. Installing dependencies

```
npm i --production
```

If you didn't build the Node.JS project manually with ICU support, then you may need to install `full-icu` package:

- Run command `npm i full-icu`
- Edit your `./run.sh` / `./run.bat` to include `--icu-data-dir=node_modules/full-icu` argument

### 5. Booting up! üöÄ

Final step, let's see how it works!

If your server is on Linux-based system, type:

```bash
chmod +x ./run.sh
# ^ to make file executable, you need this only one time

./run.sh
# to boot the bot
```

For Windows we have `.bat` file too.

```bat
./run.bat
```

---

Bot should start up normally. If it does not, please go to our Discord servers for troubleshooting together.
